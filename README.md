Fyyur
Fyyur is an application where musical artists can meet musical venues.

Artists and venues can visit this site in order to post information about themselves as well as find each other.
This site lists information about different venues across different cities, as well as different artists that exist.
From here, you can also discover shows where different artists are playing at different venues.
On this site, you have a chance to post a venue and list a new venue if that venue hasn't yet been listed, you could do the same thing with artists as well as shows, you can also find artists and venues.
For a particular artist, you can view information about their genre, contact information, whether or not they are currently seeking talent, as well as information about their upcoming and past shows.
There's also information about artists here who are also seeking performance venues to play at, as well as information about their upcoming and past shows.


Generally speaking, this app works perfectly with mock data, and we'd like the app to work perfectly as well when we connect it to a real relational database using real data. We'd like to use SQLAlchemy all run throughout, and have this connect to a Postgres database.

We recommend working in the provided classroom workspaces; however, there's additional guidance on this project listed in the README which will give you instructions on how to start and run the local development server, as well as generally what to look for, what the acceptance criteria of this project is, as well as how to create a stand-out submission that implements more than what we asked for.
